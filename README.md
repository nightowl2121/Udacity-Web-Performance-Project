# Optimizations

## Index.html
I eliminated some reder blocking by inlining the necessary CSS and moving the links to the style sheets to the bottom of the code right before `</body>`.

I also eliminated some render blocking by asynchronously loading the JavaScript files in lines 149 & 150.

## Pizza.html
No optimizations were made to **pizza.html**. I successfully got the pizza page to 60fps by only editing main.js.

## Main.js
1.
        // Moves the sliding background pizzas based on scroll position
        function updatePositions() {
        // document.body.scrollTop is no longer supported in Chrome.
          var scrollTop = document.documentElement.scrollTop || document.body.scrollTop;
          var items = document.querySelectorAll('.mover');
          frame++;
          window.performance.mark("mark_start_frame");

          // Sets the new location of each moving pizza when the page is scrolled
          for (var i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
            var phase = Math.sin((scrollTop / 1250) + (i % 5));
            // The following line of code is from a user on Slack that I helped with this project
            // Used with permission
            items[i].style.transform = "translateX(" + (700 * phase) + "px)";
          }
          
In this snippet of code, I moved `var scrollTop` and `var items` higher up in the function

I also added `items[i].style.transform` to make the pizza scrolling happen more quickly

2.
        // Generates the sliding pizzas when the page loads.
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
          var cols = 3;
          var s = 256;
          // Horizontal space b/w moving pizzas
          var l = 556;
          for (var i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
            var elem = document.createElement('img');
            elem.className = 'mover';
            elem.src = "images/pizza.png";
            elem.style.height = "50px";
            elem.style.width = "36.65px";
            // Determines the amount of space between each pizza
            elem.basicLeft = (i % cols) * l;
            elem.style.top = (Math.floor(i / cols) * s) + 'px';
            document.querySelector("#movingPizzas1").appendChild(elem);
          }
          updatePositions();
        });
        
In this snippet of code, I reduced the size of the moving pizzas by 50%. I also reduced the number of pizzas generated. I reduced the number of pizzas in `var cols` from 8 to 3 to lessen the number of pizzas in each row.

Reducing the number of pizzas in each row messed up the spacing, so I created another variable called `l` and set it to my desired spacing between each pizza. I then added that variable to to `elem.basicLeft`

3.
        // Iterates through pizza elements on the page and changes their widths
          // This chunk of code was taken from the course video called "Quiz: Stop FSL" 
          // ^^^(Section 5: Advanced Interactive Websites, Lesson 8: Styles and Layouts, Video 10) 
          function changePizzaSizes(size) {
            // Assigns the width for each pizza size
            switch(size) {
              case "1":
                newWidth = 25;
                break;
              case "2":
                newWidth = 33.3;
                break;
              case "3":
                newWidth = 50;
                break;
              default:
                console.log("bug in sizeSwitcher");
            }

            var randomPizzas = document.querySelectorAll(".randomPizzaContainer");

            // Gives the pizzas the new sizes once the slider is changed
            for (var i = 0; i < randomPizzas.length; i++) {
              randomPizzas[i].style.width = newWidth + "%";
            }
          }

          changePizzaSizes(size);
  
In this snippet of code, I got rid of the bottleneck that was causing forced synchronous layout within the pizza slider, causing the pizza to change sizes in under 1ms.
